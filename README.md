Fitness Plan Prediction Project
A web application that predicts personalized fitness plans using machine learning models (Artificial Neural Network and XGBoost). The project consists of a Flask-based backend for predictions and a React-based frontend for user interaction, styled with Tailwind CSS.
Features

Predicts fitness plans based on user inputs (age, weight, height, heart rate, etc.).
Uses two machine learning models: ANN and XGBoost for robust recommendations.
Responsive frontend with a user-friendly form interface.
Local development setup with Flask and React.

Prerequisites

Python 3.9+
Node.js 14.x or higher
Git (for cloning the repository)
pip (Python package manager)
npm (Node package manager)

Usage

Start the backend server.
Start the frontend server.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Fill out the form with your fitness data (age, weight, height, etc.) and submit to get predictions.

Contributing

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m "Add new feature").
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
Open a Pull Request on GitHub.

Inspired by fitness prediction use cases.
Built with Flask, React, Tailwind CSS, and machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, XGBoost).
Thanks to the open-source community for the tools used!
